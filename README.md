Project Name: Ticket System

Hello! This project is my interpretation on what a ticketing system would function like. You would be able to use this by creating
an account, signing in with said account, and being able to view all the tickets that are currently made or create a new one. The
idea is to use this system to assist with customers and making sure the person that is monitoring the ticket drives it to its conclusion.
This project just focuses on front-end development and login credentials are NOT secure as it just uses localStorage to store values
as of now.

Prerequisites/Installation:
N/A

Usage/Features:
-will need to make an account by clicking on the Register Here button
-when creating an account on the Registration Form, do NOT use any real credentials you may have as this is just for testing purposes
to show off the project
-email address requirements just need to have the following format: <anylettersornumbers>@<anylettersornumbers>.com -> i.e. testing@123abc.com or abc@123.com
-if the email address is already in your local storage, it will say you account exists and to sign in with it. use fake credentials please.
-password requirements are just 8 or more characters
-after that is done, you'll be able to sign in using those credentials
-here you'll be able to add a new issue. please fill in the description and assigned to fields as it will not let you add a ticket without
doing that first.
-once a ticket is created, it will display the ticket underneath and is also stored in localstorage
-you have the option to close/reopen the ticket as well as delete it, which deletes it from the page and your localstorage
-the logout button will navigate back to the login page
-you can continue to use your credentials to log back in as it is still saved to the localstorage as an object

Thank you!
